As Ana learns to program in Ruby, we are documenting it here.

We mostly use pair programming, so one of us "steers" while the other dictates directions and thoughts.

We started out in IRB, talking about what the different object types were (we covered strings and integers basically) and the different ways you can interact with the application, and the application can interact with you.

Adder.rb was the intro where I was doing the "steering", and Multiplier.rb is where I dictated a set of requirements which she translated into a functioning application. Deliberately worded the specification in a way that the order of operation would trip her up (she originally had no parenthesis) but she caught on and fixed it quickly.

Not that anything here will be likely of use, but here is the license anyway:
