Create a file called objects.rb, and in this file create the following:

A present object. A present should accept two arguments when created. The arguments will be the color of the present and the contents of the present. Both should be strings. 

The present object should have two methods, describe and unwrap. 

The describe method should print a message like the following when called for a present object with the color "blue":

The present is wrapped in shiny blue paper.

The unwrap method would print a message like the following when called for a present object with the contents "a book":

You unwrap the present to discover what you have been wanting all year... a book!

In another new file, called christmas.rb:

Require the objects.rb file.

Instantiate a new present object with a name of your choice. This present should be wrapped in purple wrapping paper, and contain a DVD.

You know what would be cool? Shaking the present for a hint.

Go back to objects.rb and add a shake method for the present object. When called on a present object with the hint "It rattles like a rattle snake." the output should look like the following:

It rattles like a rattle snake.

Also, we need to add an argument to the initialized method, hint. Hint should be a string describing the hint you get when the present gets shaken.

Now let's go back to our christmas.rb and make a hint for our DVD.

In christmas.rb, use each method of your new present object at least once.

You should now have two files, and when you run

ruby christmas.rb

You should see the output of each method of a present object.
