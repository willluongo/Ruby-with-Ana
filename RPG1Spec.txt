Create an object class called monster. A monster should take the following arguments when initialized:

name, hit points, attack points

Hit points and attack points are attributes that need to be accessible from outside the object.

A monster should have three methods: attack, defend and die.

The attack method should take a single argument, target. The attack method then picks a random number from 0 through attack points, and passes that as an argument to the target's defend method. 

The defend method should take a single argument, damage. Damage is an integer that should be subtracted from the monster's hit points. If hit points go below zero, call the die method. Display a message indicating how much damage was done, and how many hitpoints remain.

The die method should take no arguments. When called, it should display an exciting death message of your choice, for example:

The one eyed falgoon spins dramatically to the ground, clutching his right ear in agony.

Then, inherit everything from the monster class, into a new class we'll call player.

Instantiate a new player object with your name, 20 hit points, and 5 attack points.

Instantiate a new monster object with the name "Charred Chronomander", 25 hit points, and 3 attack points.

Have them fight, and see who wins.
